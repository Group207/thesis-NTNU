% Domain, backgroundm the thesis in general and in depth.
Lokførerskolen has used and uses a simulator in their eductional program for train driver students. Our bachelor project should provide guidance and a demonstration as well as an justification for the choice of game engine.

This task touches upon many domains, also including simulator driven learning. The assignment does not require the simulator to be accurate and we are not responsible for the educational functionality of the simulator after the project. This means that the responsibility to correct any functionality that is wrong in the simulator according to reality is at Lokførerskolen.
