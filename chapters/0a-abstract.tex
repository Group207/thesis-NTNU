The Norwegian Train Driver Academy (Lokførerskolen) utilizes train simulation to educate locomotive drivers. Their proprietary simulator, Desksim, was written in Java using the increasingly outdated game engine jMonkeyEngine from 2003. To future-proof and mitigate any risk of obsolescence, Lokførerskolen started their long-term project of migrating the project to a modern game engine. To help with this, we were tasked
with analysing suitable game engines for the new simulator, as well as developing a prototype in the game engine of choice. This thesis presents the details of analysing game engines, and train simulator development using Unreal Engine with \cpp. The resulting prototype simulates a train driving on rails, manages train signals and systems, and offers a separate mode for editing a scenario.
